# Full-Duplex-Jamming-for-Secrecy

All code was developed in GNU-radio, and USRPs B210 from Ettus Research were used.

In the folder project you can find:

(1) Main GNU radio flow grath (FG) of the full-duplex jamming for secrecy system.

(2) The MSc thesis "PHYSICAL-LAYER SECURITY WITH INTERFERENCE GENERATION BY THE RECEIVER" (from André Silva, developed at Instituto de Telecomunicações-University of Coimbra, Portugal) as support documment of the project.

(3) The GNU-radio FG, organized according thesis chapters, that allow to reproduce thesis results.

(4) Out-of-tree (OOT) GNU-radio blocks with new GNU-radio functions used in the full-duplex jamming for secrecy system, that were develloped within the scope of the project that disn't exist previously in GNU-radio.
